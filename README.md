Repository to Share the Automations I create for [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

## Launch Work Apps
Source: _launch-work-apps
_
This workflow launches all the applications I need for work.

The key word is 'work'.

The default list of applications is:
 - Todoist
 - Fantastical
 - Airmail 3
 - Slack
 - Tweetbot

 ## Get Firefox URL
 Source: _get-firefox-url_
 
 This workflow copies the URL of the active tab in Firefox to the clipboard.  This is all done via a simple AppleScript (also included in the repo).

 The key word is 'furl'.
